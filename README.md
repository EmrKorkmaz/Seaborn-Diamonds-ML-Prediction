**Data Analysis and Model Building Project**

## Description

This repository contains a data analysis and model building project with four main steps:

1. **01_data_check_and_preparation**: In this step, we perform data checking and preparation tasks, including data cleaning and handling missing values.

2. **02_data_visualization**: This section focuses on data visualization, where we explore the dataset through various graphs and charts to gain insights.

3. **03_data_transformation.ipynb**: Data transformation is a crucial step where we preprocess the data for model building. This includes feature engineering, encoding categorical variables, and scaling.

4. **04_model_building_and_evaluation**: In the final step, we build and evaluate machine learning models using the prepared data.

## Getting Started

To run the code and reproduce the results, follow the instructions in each step's respective Jupyter Notebook.
