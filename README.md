# Seaborn-Diamonds-ML-Prediction

**Data Analysis and Model Building Project**

## Description

This repository contains a data analysis and model building project with four main steps:

1. **01_data_check_and_preparation**: In this step, we perform data checking and preparation tasks, including handling missing values and drop duplicated values.

2. **02_data_visualization**: In the second step, focused on data visualization, where we explore the dataset through various graphs and charts to gain insights.

3. **03_data_transformation.ipynb**: In the third step, non-numeric data were converted into numerical data so that the models could be trained more successfully.

4. **04_model_building_and_evaluation**: In the final step, machine learning models were created and evaluated using the prepared data.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries used (e.g., Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn)
